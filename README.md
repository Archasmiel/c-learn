- ‚úÖ String/Char Processing (prog9‚Äì14)
- ‚úÖ Functions & Structuring (prog15)
- ‚úÖ Line Handling & Buffers (prog16‚Äì20)
- ‚úÖ Tab/Space Logic (prog21‚Äì22)
- ‚úÖ Advanced Input (prog23‚Äì24)

## Programs Overview

| Filename   | Description                                                  |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `prog1.c`  | Printing to the terminal.|
| `prog2.c`  | Printing using a slightly different approach.|
| `prog3.c`  | While loops and formatting in Celsius-Fahrenheit code.|
| `prog4.c`  | Better version of `prog3.c` with for-loops.|
| `prog5.c`  | Console reading, EOF.|
| `prog6.c`  | For loop character counting, floating numbers.|
| `prog7.c`  | Newline character counter, if conditions.|
| `prog8.c`  | Newline, blank, tab counter, mass assignment.|
| `prog9.c`  | Space character reducing between words.|
| `prog10.c` | Handles and prints tab, backspace, and backslash characters.|
| `prog11.c` | Counts lines, words, and characters; prints each word on a new line.|
| `prog12.c` | Number of digits, whitespaces and other chars in input.|
| `prog13.c` | Generates a horizontal and vertical histogram of word lengths.|
| `prog14.c` | Frequency histogram (horizontal) of alphabet chars.|
| `prog15.c` | Functions, function prototypes, improving `prog4.c`.|
| `prog16.c` | Max length line searching, no memory tools.|
| `prog17.c` | Arbitrary input length version of `prog16.c`, no memory tools. ‚≠ê |
| `prog18.c` | Printing lines that are bigger than 80 characters.|
| `prog19.c` | Trailing tabs and newlines removing.|
| `prog20.c` | Trimming line as `prog19.c`, also reversing input line.|
| `prog21.c` | Replaces runs of spaces with tabs (entab), using optimal alignment.|
| `prog22.c` | Replaces tabs with spaces (detab), expanding to correct alignment.|
| `prog23.c` | Line folding, based on nearest tab or whitespace _(fwrite, memmove)_. ‚≠ê |
| `prog24.c` | Removes all C-style comments (`//` and `/* */`) safely from a file. üß† |

## üöÄ How to Compile & Run

```bash
gcc progX.c -o progX
./progX
```

## üöÄ Purpose
This repository contains a series of small C programs inspired by *The C Programming Language* (K&R) and other learning materials. Each program builds on core language features such as I/O, control flow, string handling, and file processing. 

The goal is to build a solid foundation in C through progressive, well-documented practice files.
